    <span>My name is Viktor, and I'm 21 years old. I live in Copenhagen, where I study It-Architecture at KEA.</span>
    <p>I am from Denmark, and I'm half danish, half hungarian. I love traveling, skiing and video games. In my free time, I like to game and watch tv-shows, when I'm not doing homework. I am a ski-instructor and have worked for a whole season i Switzerland and Spain in different ski schools. I have also worked in a kindergarten, and have previously studied at Baltorp Business Gymnasium.</p>
